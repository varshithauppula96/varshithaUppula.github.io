About
======
Hi! Iâ€™m Varshitha Uppula, a Masters Student at the Northeastern University, Boston(Massachusetts) in the Department of Computer Science. I love coding and working on new ideas to solve some day to day problems. I am currently working on my coop at Bigelow Laboratories and have 2 years of expierence in Accenture(India) as a Software developer.
In my free time, I like to dance, paint, play some sports, read and try to learn something new!

My Background and History
======
I completed my schooling in India from Ryan international School(Bangalore) in the field of Physics, Chemistry, Maths, and Computer Science. I did my undergraduate from 
PES institute of Technology in Electronics and Communication where I have learnt topics and subjects about Operating Systems, Assembly level programming, a few Computer Science electives, Logic Deisgning. During my undergraduate I have done a couple of mini personal projects, Academic projects and participated in various Hackathons. I interned at Free Spirits Green Labs during my 3rd year of college where I designed solar related circuits and created a simple web page for users to access, like and view the content. My incline in the field of Computer science had me taking various online courses to learn topics relavant to programming. After my undergrad, I worked at Accenture(India) for 2 years on SAP ABAP. During this period I wanted to take my career further by pursuing a master in Computer Science, and now here I am currently doing my masters in Northeastern University in Computer Science! Here I was a Teaching Assistant for subjects in database management and discreet structures in Maths. I was also a Research Assistant during the summer where I worked on data Visualization. I am currently doing a Coop at Bigelow Laboratories(Maine) to create a web application to visualise data pertaining to eDNA.

Projects I've worked on in brief
------
I love and enjoy working on projects, and below is a brief description of a few projects that I've worked on -


**project 1- **

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
