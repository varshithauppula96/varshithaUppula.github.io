Hi! Iâ€™m Varshitha Uppula, a Masters Student at the Northeastern University, Boston(Massachusetts) in the Department of Computer Science. I love coding and working on new ideas to solve some day to day problems. I am currently working on my coop at Bigelow Laboratories and have 2 years of expierence in Accenture(India) as a Software developer.
In my free time, I like to dance, paint, play some sports, read and try to learn something new!

My Background and History
======
I completed my schooling in India from Ryan international School(Bangalore) in the field of Physics, Chemistry, Maths, and Computer Science. I did my undergraduate from 
PES institute of Technology in Electronics and Communication where I have learnt topics and subjects about Operating Systems, Assembly level programming, a few Computer Science electives, Logic Deisgning. During my undergraduate I have done a couple of mini personal projects, Academic projects and participated in various Hackathons. I interned at Free Spirits Green Labs during my 3rd year of college where I designed solar related circuits and created a simple web page for users to access, like and view the content. My incline in the field of Computer science had me taking various online courses to learn topics relavant to programming. After my undergrad, I worked at Accenture(India) for 2 years on SAP ABAP. During this period I wanted to take my career further by pursuing a master in Computer Science, and now here I am currently doing my masters in Northeastern University in Computer Science! Here I was a Teaching Assistant for subjects in database management and discreet structures in Maths. I was also a Research Assistant during the summer where I worked on data Visualization. I am currently doing a Coop at Bigelow Laboratories(Maine) to create a web application to visualise data pertaining to eDNA.

Projects I've worked on in brief
------
I love and enjoy working on projects, and below is a brief description of a few projects that I've worked on -


**Covid-Contact-Tracing**

Designed and implemented a Relational database using MySql for Covid contact tracing system. 
Data about Covid test taken is maintained and used to determine the Infection status of user.
User reports their symptoms, countries visited within the last year, and their gps location data is tracked.
Triggers and stored procedures were used to automatically change status of user as infected, safe or suspect based on the symptoms, contact with Covid suspect, travel history.

**Cell search and selection**

A model to link the user equipment with the base station by providing synchronization in frequency and time using PSS and SSS signals transmitted and recieved over a radio frame.
This method performs the symbol timing and physical layer sector identity estimations in frequency domain with less complexity, utilising the frequency domain properties of a primary synchronisation signal.

 Tools: Matlab coding and knowledge of digital communication

**Asynchronous-quantum-job-submission-framework**

The goal of the project is to offer an Asynchronous Quantum Job Framework that would create an easy interface for users to submit quantum jobs and retrieve results in an asynchronous manner. We will also build the required REST APIs in Python to expose functionality to submit a job, retrieve information about a job that has already completed and find the status of a job that is being processed.

This framework acts as a facade for the user to interact with switchable quantum workload processing backends. And also handles the burden of storing the result of quantum workloads in a secure, reliable and persistent manner.

**project 1-**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
