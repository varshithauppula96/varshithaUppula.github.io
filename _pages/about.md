Hi! Iâ€™m Varshitha Uppula, a Masters Student at the Northeastern University, Boston(Massachusetts) in the Department of Computer Science. I love coding and working on new ideas to solve some day to day problems. I am currently working on my coop at Bigelow Laboratories and have 2 years of expierence in Accenture(India) as a Software developer.
In my free time, I like to dance, paint, play some sports, read and try to learn something new!

My Background and History

During my undergraduate I have done a couple of mini personal projects, Academic projects and participated in various Hackathons. I interned at Free Spirits Green Labs during my 3rd year of college where I designed solar related circuits and created a simple web page for users to access, like and view the content. My incline in the field of Computer science had me taking various online courses to learn topics relavant to programming. After my undergrad, I worked at Accenture(India) for 2 years on SAP ABAP. During this period I wanted to take my career further by pursuing a master in Computer Science, and now here I am currently doing my masters in Northeastern University in Computer Science! Here I was a Teaching Assistant for subjects in database management and discreet structures in Maths. I was also a Research Assistant during the summer where I worked on data Visualization.
