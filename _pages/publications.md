Projects I've worked on in brief
------
I love and enjoy working on projects, and below is a brief description of a few projects that I've worked on -


**Covid-Contact-Tracing**

Designed and implemented a Relational database using MySql for Covid contact tracing system. 
Data about Covid test taken is maintained and used to determine the Infection status of user.
User reports their symptoms, countries visited within the last year, and their gps location data is tracked.
Triggers and stored procedures were used to automatically change status of user as infected, safe or suspect based on the symptoms, contact with Covid suspect, travel history.

**Cell search and selection**

A model to link the user equipment with the base station by providing synchronization in frequency and time using PSS and SSS signals transmitted and recieved over a radio frame.
This method performs the symbol timing and physical layer sector identity estimations in frequency domain with less complexity, utilising the frequency domain properties of a primary synchronisation signal.

 Tools: Matlab coding and knowledge of digital communication

**Asynchronous-quantum-job-submission-framework**

The goal of the project is to offer an Asynchronous Quantum Job Framework that would create an easy interface for users to submit quantum jobs and retrieve results in an asynchronous manner. We will also build the required REST APIs in Python to expose functionality to submit a job, retrieve information about a job that has already completed and find the status of a job that is being processed.

This framework acts as a facade for the user to interact with switchable quantum workload processing backends. And also handles the burden of storing the result of quantum workloads in a secure, reliable and persistent manner.

**project 1-**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
